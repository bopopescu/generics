	  <p><b>** Please read these instructions carefully before

	  <p>We're interested in how natural certain English phrases
	    and sentences sound to you. For example, many English speakers feel that the sentence </p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated completely Mary</p>
	  <p>sounds somewhat strange, even though the similar
	    sentences</p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated Mary completely</p>
	  <p>and</p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated completely his audience on Saturday night</p>
	  <p>sound much more natural. We're interested in these kinds
	    of feelings -- the feeling that a phrase or sentence is natural, in
 the sense that you would not find it surprising to hear a native 
English speaker say it in conversation. We will show you a number of 
phrases and ask you to make a judgment about how natural they sound.</p>
	  <p>We are <u>not</u> concerned with whether the phrase would be 
graded highly by a writing teacher, whether it conforms with grammar 
rules that you might have learned in school, etc. We're only concerned 
with whether the phrases could be said by a native speaker of English in
 normal daily speech.</p>
	  <p>For each phrase, we will ask you to select a radio button
	    on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 means that the phrase is
	    completely unnatural and 9 means that it is completely
	    natural. Don't think too hard about your answer -- there are
	    no right or wrong answers, and this is not a memory or
	    intelligence test. We are just interested in the first
	    opinion you form about the phrases.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="instructions grammatical">
	  <p>We're interested in whether you think certain phrases and
	    sentences are meaningful English, i.e. whether an English speaker 
could reasonably use this sentence to communicate an idea. For example, 
many speakers would judge that the sentence </p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated Mary happily</p>
	  <p>could not be used by an English speaker to communicate a coherent idea. In contrast, it's easy to imagine the similar sentence</p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated Mary completely</p>
	  <p>being used. We're interested in your intuitions about this issue: 
whether you think that a phrase or sentence could be used meaningfully 
by an English speaker. We will show you a number of sentences and ask 
you to make a judgment about this.</p>
	  <p>We are <u>not</u> concerned with whether the phrase would be

rules that you might have learned in school, etc. We're only concerned

in normal daily speech.</p>
	  <p>For each phrase, we will ask you to select a radio button
	    on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 means that an English speaker
	    definitely <u>could not</u> use this sentence, and 9 means that an English speaker definitely <u>could</u>
 use this sentence. Don't think too hard about your answer -- there are 
no right or wrong answers, and this is not a memory or intelligence 
test. We are just interested in the first opinion you form about the

<p class="notcentered"><b>Instructions</b></p>
  
<p class="notcentered">The questions that you will see in this experiment are designed to
    help us understand how people draw conclusions based on some
    provided information. The experiment consists of <span class="numberofquestions">21</span> questions. In each section you will be asked to
    read a few sentences and then answer a question about them. In
    each case, the question is whether you agree with the conclusion,
    assuming that the premises are true.
  You'll be given the option to respond either 'Agree' or
    'Disagree' and asked to indicate your confidence in your
    answer.
  </p>
  
<p class="notcentered">
Some of the questions will mention unfamiliar words or
    objects. In these cases, you should just make your best guess
    about whether the conclusion is a good one. For example, you might
    see an argument like this:
</p>
<p class="centered">
Horses have BCC in their blood.<br>
Cows have BCC in their blood.<br>
So, donkeys have BCC in their blood.
</p>
<p class="notcentered">Even if you don't know what "BCC" is, you can probably form a
    reasonable guess about whether this is a good conclusion. It's
    OK to enter this guess, even if you aren't completely sure.
</p>
<p class="notcentered">Please click 'Begin' when you're ready to start
the experiment.</p>
